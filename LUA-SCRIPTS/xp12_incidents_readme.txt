xp12_incidents_v3.lua — Reference Documentation
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
xp12_incidents is a custom failure and incident system for X-Plane 12, running
as a FlyWithLua NG+ script. It extends and replaces X-Plane's built-in failure
manager with the following key differences:

  1. Scheduled randomness — failures trigger automatically over time based on a
     configurable mean time between failures (MTBF). X-Plane's native system
     requires manual setup per session; this script runs autonomously.

  2. Conditions — failures only trigger when realistic preconditions are met
     (e.g. on ground with engine off, engine running, airborne). The native
     system has no such guards.

  3. Custom failures — FUEL_CAP, FUEL_LEAK, and door failures (DOOR_OPEN) are not simple DataRef toggles but simulate physical
     effects over time via their own drain or state routines. They cannot be
     replicated with the native failure manager.

  4. Fix conditions — certain failures clear automatically when the real-world
     corrective action is performed (e.g., switching all electrics off clears
     cockpit smoke). The native system requires manual reset.

  5. Memory — states persist across sessions in a profile memory file (except environmental failure).
     The aircraft resumes exactly where it left off. Battery charge (watt-hours) is saved at
     engine-off and restored on the next session.
  6. Aircraft profiles — the config file defines failure sets per aircraft ICAO
     code. On load the script reads the aircraft ICAO and applies the matching
     profile. All settings in a profile override only those entries listed;
     everything else falls back to [DEFAULT]. 

SCRIPT MODES
-------------
SCRIPT-MODE setting in the config:

  ON           — failures are active immediately on load.
  OFF          — all automatic triggering disabled; manual toggle only.
  <minutes>    — RANDOM mode: one randomly selected failure triggers
                 within this time window. After it fires, a new window begins.

Per-failure MTBF (in hours): probability is calculated per tick. A failure
with MTBF = 100 has a 1% chance per hour, spread over the tick interval.

==============================================================================
POP-UP, STATUS DISPLAY AND COMMANDS
==============================================================================

Popups (shown for 5 seconds in the status overlay area):
  "-- ACTIVE --"       Script resumed or loaded in active state.
  "-- PAUSED --"       Script paused.
  "-- PROFILE RESET --"
  "-- ALL TRIGGERED --" / "-- ALL RESET --"
  "TANK CAP CHECKED"
  "FUEL TANK DRAINED"
  "DOOR 1 LATCHED" / "DOOR 2 LATCHED" / "DOORS LATCHED"
  
Status display can be toggled via FLW-macro or assigned key.
The display has a fixed header and two sections below:

  Header (always visible, white):
    Line 1: "xp12 Incidents   Status Display"
    Line 2: "MODE: <mode>   PROFILE: <profile>"
    Line 3: "THREATS: HIDDEN/VISIBLE   COND: ON/OFF"

  OVERVOLTAGE TEST MODE (always visible when active, orange)
    Shown directly below the header whenever overvolt test mode is armed,
    regardless of the threats visibility setting. No popup is shown.

  THREATS + FAILURES (above guards, toggleable)
    Active failures (red) and threat warnings (orange). Hidden by default
    so the pilot cannot see what is lurking. Toggle with:
      FlyWithLua/Incidents/toggle_threats
    Popup and status line confirm current state.
      "FUEL TYPE: PENDING"    (orange) Refueling detected — FUEL_TYPE possible.
      "BAT: LOW"              (orange) Battery charge below 25 % of maximum.

  GUARDS (bottom, always visible, green)
    Active preflight and safety guards — always shown regardless of the
    threats visibility setting.
      "FUEL CAPS: CHECKED"  Cap check done — FUEL_CAP blocked.
      "FUEL TANKS: DRAINED" Drain check done — FUEL_WATER blocked.
      "DOOR 1/2: LATCHED"   Door latch guard active.

                                           status display. Guards (green) are always
                                           visible. Default: HIDDEN.                                           

Per-failure commands (one per failure):
  FlyWithLua/Incidents/<failure_key_lowercase>
  Example: FlyWithLua/Incidents/eng_fail_1
  Toggles the failure: triggers if inactive, resets if active.

  Per-failure commands will only trigger if conditions are met (default).
  Use toggle conditions to set conditions to OFF.
  Per-failure will then trigger unconditional.


==============================================================================
AIRCRAFT PROFILES AND OVERRIDE LOGIC
==============================================================================

The config file (xp12_incidents_config.txt) contains one [DEFAULT] section
and one section per supported aircraft. Each profile entry can be:

  OFF        — failure disabled for this aircraft
  DEFAULT    — use the DEFAULT_MTBF value from the global setting
  <hours>    — specific MTBF in hours for this failure for this aircraft

A dedicated model profile (e.g., [BE58], [C172]) only needs to list deviations
from [DEFAULT]. Failures not listed in a profile keep their DEFAULT value.

If the loaded aircraft ICAO matches no profile, [DEFAULT] applies in full.

IMPORTANT: For aircraft managed by a dedicated simulation add-on (e.g.,
SimCoders Baron 58 REP), the add-on intercepts many X-Plane failure
DataRefs and manages them internally. Setting such a failure in the script will
have no effect or unpredictable results. These failures can be set to OFF in the
respective profile. See the aircraft-specific sections at the end of this file.

Failures without effect on the profile aircraft will not trigger anything.
But if you are in SCRIPT MODE RANDOM an uneffective failure may triggered.
If it is your intension to really have one failure at least triggeres effectively,
set aircraft profile appropriate.

CONDITIONS:

  (none)            — no restriction; can trigger at any time
  ground_engine_off — on the ground, engines off
  engine            — at least one engine must be running
  engine_or_elec    — one engine running or electrical bus powered
  on ground         — on the ground
  ground_roll       — on the ground, rolling (speed > 15 kn)
  airborne          — aircraft must be in the air


MTBF STATISTICAL ADJUSTMENTS:

The following failures use individually configured MTBF values that deviate
from the global DEFAULT_MTBF. Values are derived from FAA/NTSB statistical
data and adjusted to account for failure causes that are already modelled
independently by other failures in this script.

  Failure key(s)        MTBF (h)   Basis
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ENG_FAIL_1/2            9,000    See derivation note below.
  ENG_FIRE_1/2          180,000    Engine fires are extremely rare in GA;
                                   high value keeps this as a near-manual-
                                   only event.
  FUEL_PUMP_1/2          25,600    FAA mechanical failure statistics for
                                   engine-driven fuel pumps.
  OIL_PUMP_1/2           80,000    FAA / manufacturer data for oil pumps.
  MAG_L1/R1/L2/R2        54,000    FAA magneto service difficulty reports.
  VACUUM_1/2                500    Statistical failure rate for vacuum pumps
                                   is significantly higher than DEFAULT_MTBF
                                   implies; value reflects actual field data.
  GENERATOR_1/2           2,000    Statistical failure rate for alternators /
                                   generators is significantly higher than
                                   DEFAULT_MTBF; value reflects field data.

ENG_FAIL — Derivation
  FAA data places the overall piston-GA engine failure MTBF at approximately
  3,200 h. However, nearly 50 % of all reported engine failures are
  attributable to human-factor fuel events — fuel exhaustion, fuel
  starvation, wrong fuel type, and fuel contamination. These causes are
  modelled separately in this script (FUEL_CAP, FUEL_WATER, FUEL_TYPE,
  FUEL_PUMP_LO, FUEL_BLOCK). Removing this share from the raw statistic
  doubles the effective MTBF for the remaining mechanical failures to
  approximately 6,400 h.
  Additional failure modes that can lead to engine stoppage — magneto
  failure, oil pressure loss, airflow restriction — are each modelled
  independently as well (MAG, OIL_PUMP, OIL_PRESS_LO, AIRFLOW). Excluding
  their statistical contribution yields the configured value of 9,000 h,
  which represents the residual purely-mechanical engine failure rate after
  all separately-modelled contributors have been removed.


==============================================================================
 ENVIRONMENT FAILURES
==============================================================================

VASI
----
Effect:    PAPI/VASI approach lights fail. No visual glidepath reference on
           approach.
Condition: None — can trigger at any time. (if a failure description shows no condtion, it is "none")
Fix:       None. Reset profile or toggle manually. (if a failure description shows no fix, there is no fix)

RWY_LIGHTS
----------
Effect:    Runway lighting fails.

SMOKE
-----
Effect:    Cockpit smoke appears (X-Plane rel_smoke_cpit failure). 
Condition: Engine running OR electrical bus powered (engine_or_elec).
Fix:       Switch OFF all electrical (batteries, avionics master, generators).
           One of these is randomly assigned as the culprit and shown in the status
           display (20% battery, 20% generator, 60% avionics bus).
           Turning on the culprit will trigger smoke again.

           Smoke from engine fire (ENG_FIRE_1/2 followup) has no fix
           — reset the profile or toggle manually.

BIRD_ENG1 / BIRD_ENG2
----------------------
Effect:    Bird strike specifically directed at engine 1 or engine 2 intake.
           May cause engine damage, fire, or failure.
           On a single-engine aircraft BIRD_ENG2 is set to OFF — birds will
           pass nearby without striking.
Condition: Airborne only.

DOOR_OPEN
---------
Effect:    Custom failure. Opens one physical aircraft door by writing to the
           X-Plane door DataRef. The failure system performs a dice roll among
           all available non-open doors. If the selected door has a latch guard
           set, it does not open and nothing is shown — the latch held.
           If an unlatched door is selected, it opens and the status display
           shows it as active.
Condition: no latch guard: A latched door cannot be opened by the failure system. 
Prevention: 
           Latch guard: After closing a door it is automatically latched. 
           For preflight check open and close each door.
           A popup "DOOR 1 LATCHED" or "DOOR 2 LATCHED" confirms the guard.
           To latch all available doors at once, use the command latch_all_doors.
           Opening a door clears the latch for that door.
           Latch state is saved per profile in the memory file.
           To begin a new flight with door unlatches, previous flight must
           be left with door(s) open.
Fix:       Close the door. X-Plane allows closing any door via command regardless
           of seat position. In a real aircraft a passenger door out of reach
           cannot be closed from the cockpit — the pilot's decision whether to
           use the command or leave the door open until landing.

FUEL_CAP
--------
Effect:    Custom failure — simulates a missing or loose fuel cap on one
           randomly selected tank. Fuel drains at a high initial rate
           (≈1 kg/s) that decreases over time to ≈0.05 kg/s. Stops when
           the affected tank reaches 0.5 kg remaining.
Condition: Airborne only. tank cap guard missing.
Prevention:
           Preflight walk-around check: switch to any external view while on
           the ground with both engines off. The script detects the external
           view and sets the tank cap check, blocking all automatic
           FUEL_CAP triggers for that flight. A popup "TANK CAP CHECKED"
           confirms this. The check status is saved to memory immediately.
           The check is invalidated if fuel quantity rises by more than 1 kg
           compared to the last engine-off snapshot (refueling detected).
           Refueling is detected continuously while parked with engine off.

FUEL_WATER
----------
Effect:    Water contamination in fuel. Engine may run for a few seconds after
           start but will not sustain operation and will not restart.
Condition: On the ground, engine off (ground_engine_off).
Prevention:
           Fuel drain check: switch to any external view with engine off, then
           use the command FlyWithLua/Incidents/drain_fuel_tanks. The script
           confirms with a popup "FUEL TANKS DRAINED" and shows "FUEL TANKS: DRAINED"
           in the status display. The check records the sim date (local_date_days)
           and expires the next sim day — independent of refueling.
Note:      Does not work on the B58 (SimCoders REP).

FUEL_TYPE
---------
Effect:    Wrong fuel type loaded. Engine flames out after a short period;
           propeller will no longer turn with the starter.
Condition: On the ground AND refueling detected. Wrong fuel type is typically
           noticed during engine start, run-up, or taxi — it is unlikely to go
           undetected until airborne. The failure will not trigger in the air.
           The script monitors fuel quantity while parked with engine off. When
           a refueling is detected (fuel rises by more than 1 kg), the failure
           becomes pending. Status display shows "FUEL TYPE: PENDING" in orange.
           The pending state clears automatically at liftoff.
Note:      Does not work on the B58 (SimCoders REP).


==============================================================================
 ENGINE FAILURES
==============================================================================

Note:      Engine failures do not work on the B58 (SimCoders REP).

ENG_FAIL_1 / ENG_FAIL_2
------------------------
Effect:    Complete engine failure.
Condition: Engine running.

ENG_FIRE_1 / ENG_FIRE_2
------------------------
Effect:    Engine fire. 
           With 75% probability, cockpit smoke (SMOKE) is triggered as an automatic followup. 
           Smoke from engine fire has no fix.
Condition: Engine running.

STARTER_1 / STARTER_2
----------------------
Effect:    Starter motor fails. Engine cannot be cranked. 

MAG_L1 / MAG_L2 / MAG_R1 / MAG_R2
-----------------------------------
Effect:    Left or right magneto failure on engine 1 or 2. 
           RPM drop on the affected engine; massive drop during magneto check.

FUEL_PUMP_LO_1 / FUEL_PUMP_LO_2
---------------------------------
Effect:    Fuel pump low pressure — pump runs but produces insufficient pressure.
           Causes float in fuel flow and RPM. 

FUEL_PUMP_1 / FUEL_PUMP_2
--------------------------
Effect:    Mechanical (engine-driven) fuel pump failure.
           Engines dies.

ELE_FUEL_PMP_1 / ELE_FUEL_PMP_2
---------------------------------
Effect:    Electric fuel (boost) pump failure. 

FUEL_FLOW_1 / FUEL_FLOW_2
--------------------------
Effect:    Irregular fuel supply causing flow fluctuations.
           Causes similar float in fuel flow and RPM like fuel pump LO.
           This failure represents other icurrences, i.e. blockage.
Note:      FUEL_BLOCK_1/2 have been removed from the script due to ineffectiveness.

FUEL_LEAK
---------
Effect:    Custom failure — active fuel leak. Side determined randomly:
           40% left tank only, 40% right tank only, 20% both tanks.
           Drain rate starts low (≈0.1 kg/s) and increases over time up to
           1.0 kg/s. Stops at 0.5 kg remaining in the affected tank(s).
           State is memory-persistent — survives sessions.
Condition: Engine running.

OIL_PUMP_1 / OIL_PUMP_2
------------------------
Effect:    Oil pump failure. Oil pressure will drop to zero.
           Rise in oil temperature, significant loss of power.
Note:      OIL_PRESS_LO_1/2 have been removed from the script due to ineffectiveness.


AIRFLOW_ENG1 / AIRFLOW_ENG2
----------------------------
Effect:    Airflow restriction to the engine (induction system).
           Loss of power, significant drop in EGT.

==============================================================================
 PROPELLER FAILURES  (constant-speed props only)
==============================================================================

Note:      Prop failures do not work on the B58 (SimCoders REP).
Note:      All prop failures not working on fixed blade propellers.

PROP_FINE_1 / PROP_FINE_2
--------------------------
Effect:    Propeller governor fails toward fine pitch. Overspeed tendency;
           high RPM at reduced power settings.

PROP_COARSE_1 / PROP_COARSE_2
------------------------------
Effect:    Propeller governor fails toward coarse pitch. Inability to achieve
           full RPM; reduced climb performance.

==============================================================================
 ELECTRICAL FAILURES
==============================================================================

Note: All electrical failures are disabled for the B58 (SimCoders REP manages
the entire electrical system). See aircraft limitations.

BATTERY_1 / BATTERY_2
----------------------
Effect:    Battery failure. If generator is also off or fails subsequently,
           complete electrical shutdown follows.
Note:      Even though battery fails, still there might be volts indicated.

Note:      BAT0_LO / BAT1_LO and BAT0_HI / BAT1_HI have been removed from the
           script. The voltage-override DataRefs are broken in X-Plane: BAT_HI
           forces the bus to 31 V regardless of actual watt-hour state, so all
           devices keep running even with Wh = 0 — the failure produces no
           realistic consequence. Battery damage from overvoltage is modelled
           instead via BATTERY_1 in the GEN_HI overvoltage cascade (Tier 2).
           Battery depletion from under-voltage is handled by the watt-hour
           persistence system (see below).

GENERATOR_1 / GENERATOR_2
--------------------------
Effect:    Generator  failure. Loss of volts.
           Ammeter shows discharge. Battery becomes sole power source.

GEN0_LO / GEN1_LO
-----------------
Effect:    Generator voltage low. AMP meter shows discharge; battery becomes
           the sole power source and drains. If the engine continues to run
           with GEN_LO active, battery charge will deplete within the session.
           The depleted charge is saved at engine-off and persists to the next
           flight — the battery may not have enough power for a restart.

GEN0_HI / GEN1_HI — OVERVOLTAGE CASCADE
-----------------------------------------
Effect:    Generator voltage high. Bus rises to ≈31 V. AMP increases,
           battery overcharges. BAT_HI appears as a display consequence.

           The script runs a time-dependent damage cascade for all powered
           avionics on the affected bus. Probability of device failure
           increases quadratically with elapsed time (Rayleigh model):
           very low in the first minute, likely after 60 min, certain by ~5 h.
           Only devices that are currently powered and not already failed
           can be damaged. Devices are grouped into three tiers:

             Tier 1 (most vulnerable — glass cockpit / navigation / radios):
               G1000 PFD, MFD, GIA1, GIA2, GEA, ADR1, ADR2, AHRS1, AHRS2,
               Magnetometer, G1000 ASI / ALT / VVI, G430 GPS1 / GPS2,
               Autopilot computer, NAVCOM1 / NAVCOM2.

             Tier 2 (moderately vulnerable — engine instruments / battery):
               Transponder, DME, ADF1, Marker beacon, Weather radar,
               RPM / MP / CHT / EGT / FF / Fuel-P /
               Oil-P / Oil-T indicators (engines 1 and 2), Battery 1.

             Tier 3 (least vulnerable — lights):
               Beacon, Nav, Strobe, Taxi, Landing, Instrument, Cockpit.

           The cascade starts immediately when GEN_HI is triggered and
           resumes after an aircraft reload if GEN_HI was active in memory.
           Resetting GEN_HI stops the cascade; already-failed devices remain.

Note:      DO-160 tolerance for 28 V avionics is approximately 32 V for a
           limited duration — this is why the cascade starts slowly.
           When BATTERY_1 fails in the cascade, the battery is disconnected
           from the bus. With the generator still running, devices continue
           to operate; loss of power only occurs if the generator also fails
           or is switched off.

ELEC_BUS1 / ELEC_BUS2
----------------------
Effect:    Main or secondary electrical bus failure.
           All equipment on that bus loses power.

==============================================================================
ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC FAILURE CHAINS
==============================================================================

AVIONICS-ON GENERATOR TRANSITION — BUS SPIKE DAMAGE
----------------------------------------------------
Effect:    Switching the avionics master ON before the generator is stable
           (startup), or leaving it ON while switching the generator OFF
           (shutdown), can produce a voltage spike on the avionics bus.
           Each generator transition (on→off or off→on) with the avionics
           master powered is evaluated independently:

             25% chance: one random Tier-1 device is immediately damaged.
             Selection is uniform among all Tier-1 devices that are
             currently not failed and not profile-disabled.

           Standard procedure to avoid this:
             Startup:  avionics OFF → start engine → generator stable → avionics ON.
             Shutdown: avionics OFF → generator OFF → battery OFF.

Note:      Only active for generators whose GEN_HI failure is not profile-OFF.
           The B58 (all electrical OFF) is therefore excluded entirely.

BATTERY CHARGE PERSISTENCE
--------------------------
X-Plane resets battery charge to full at every flight start. The script
overrides this by saving the watt-hour value at engine-off and restoring it
on the next session:

  - Save:    When engine transitions from running to off, current charge is
             written to the memory file.
  - Restore: On script load or aircraft change, the saved value is written
             back. A sudden jump of more than 50 Wh (X-Plane reset) triggers
             the restore; a gradual rise (ground power charging) is followed
             legitimately.
  - Warning: When charge drops below 25 % of maximum, "BAT: LOW" appears in
             the status display in orange.
  - Cure:    Connect native ground power (X-Plane handles the charge rate),
             or use the command FlyWithLua/Incidents/recharge_bat to jump
             directly to 80 % capacity. Reset profile also resets battery.


==============================================================================

==============================================================================
 AUTOPILOT FAILURES
==============================================================================

AP_COMPUTER
-----------
Effect:    Autopilot computer failure. AP disconnects and cannot be re-engaged.
           No aural chime, no annunciator — silent failure.

AP_RUNAWAY
----------
Effect:    Autopilot runs away — commands uncontrolled pitch/roll inputs.
Fix:       Disconnect autopilot immediately.

AP_SERVOS
---------
Effect:    All AP servos fail. Disconnect chime sounds. AP indicators
           remain illuminated, but the autopilot has no authority.

AP_SERVO_ELEV
-------------
Effect:    Elevator servo restricted. Altitude deviations under AP control.

AP_SERVO_AILN
-------------
Effect:    Aileron servo restricted. AP reacts slowly or rarely to heading
           deviations.

AP_SERVO_RUDD
-------------
Effect:    Yaw damper/rudder servo restricted.

==============================================================================
 SYSTEMS FAILURES
==============================================================================

PITOT_HEAT_1 / PITOT_HEAT_2
----------------------------
Effect:    Pitot heat element failure. In icing conditions, pitot tube may block.

AOA_HEAT
--------
Effect:    Angle-of-attack probe heat failure. AOA indicator unreliable in icing conditions.

WINDOW_HEAT
-----------
Effect:    Windshield heat failure.

PROP_HEAT_1 / PROP_HEAT_2
--------------------------
Effect:    Propeller de-ice heat failure. 
Note:      On the B58, effect shows only as an ammeter drop — the dedicated prop ampmeter is not affected.

TKS_PUMP
--------
Effect:    TKS de-icing fluid pump failure. No fluid distributed to wings and
           tail. Relevant only on aircraft with TKS system.

HVAC
----
Effect:    Cabin heating/cooling system failure.

VACUUM_1 / VACUUM_2
--------------------
Effect:    Vacuum pump failure. Gyroscopic instruments driven by
           that pump spin down and become unreliable.
Note:      does not work on the B58 (SimCoders REP).

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
 SENSORS AND ANTENNAS
==============================================================================

PITOT / PITOT_2 / PITOT_STBY
---------------
Effect:    Pitot tube blocked (no heat failure, physical blockage).

STATIC / STATIC_2 / STATIC_STBY
-----------------
Effect:    Static port blocked. Altimeter, VSI, and ASI all affected.
Note:      On the B58 (two static systems): Static 1 = pilot side, Static 2 = copilot side.

STATIC_ERR_1 / STATIC_ERR_2
-----------------------------
Effect:    Static system reads low (approx. 1,200 ft error). Alternate air
           will restore function but with varying and unreliable readings.

OAT
---
Effect:    Outside air temperature probe fails.

ICE_DETECT
----------
Effect:    Ice detection system failure. Relevant only on TKS-equipped aircraft.

LOC
---
Effect:    Localizer receiver fails. LOC needle red-flags.

GLS
---
Effect:    Glide slope receiver fails. GS needle red-flags.

GPS
---
Effect:    GPS position receiver fails. Position freezes while GPS device is
           powered on.

COM1 / COM2
-----------
Effect:    COM radio antenna or RF path fails. COM1 or COM2 communication lost.
           Each Antenna fails independently.

NAV1 / NAV2
-----------
Effect:    NAV antenna fails.
Chaining:  NAV1 failure automatically triggers NAV2, verce visa. 
           If NAV Antenna fails, both all NAV-Instruments are affected
          (shared vulnerability in the nav antenna system).

==============================================================================
 GEAR FAILURES
==============================================================================

GEAR_IND
--------
Effect:    Gear position indicator fails. Unsafe / transit indications unreliable.

GEAR_ACT
--------
Effect:    Gear actuator failure. Gear cannot be extended or retracted at all.

GEAR_RET_1 / GEAR_RET_2 / GEAR_RET_3
--------------------------------------
Effect:    Individual gear leg (1=nose/front, 2=left, 3=right on tricycle) freezes in its current position. 

GEAR_COL_1 / GEAR_COL_2 / GEAR_COL_3
--------------------------------------
Effect:    Gear leg collapse on the ground.
Condition: On ground.
Note:      On the B58: gear collapse cannot be repaired in maintenance — only a new flight resets it.

TIRE_1 / TIRE_2 / TIRE_3 / TIRE_4 / TIRE_5
--------------------------------------------
Effect:    Tire blowout. Aircraft veers on rollout.
Note:      Usually 3 tires. TIRE_4 and TIRE_5 apply to aircraft with double tires.

BRAKES_L / BRAKES_R
--------------------
Effect:    Left or right braking system fails completely. Strong directional pull on braking.

==============================================================================
 CONTROL FAILURES
==============================================================================

FLAP_ACT
--------
Effect:    Both flap actuators fail. Flaps lock in current position.
Note:      Overspeed with flaps extended may cause loss of flap (without
           animation, effect still applied).

FLAP_ACT_L / FLAP_ACT_R
-------------------------
Effect:    Left or right flap actuator fails independently. Asymmetric flap
           situation — strong roll tendency.

ELV_TRIM_RUN
------------
Effect:    Electric elevator trim runs away continuously and uncontrollably.
           Aircraft pitches. Affects electric trim only — manual trim wheel
           remains functional.

Fix:       Engage and hold the autopilot & trim disconnect switch. The script monitors the cutoff.
           This may take some secaonds ; once it detects the switch held off, the runaway
           clears and the trim system is locked dead (TRIM_ELV, TRIM_AIL, TRIM_RUD triggered as followup).
           Manually trim only.
Note:      Failures has effect, even if trims are not electrical.
           Make sure to disable this failure on AC without electrical trims.
           (i.a. C172 or B58 will have electrical elevator trim; disengage aileron and rudder failure)

AIL_TRIM_RUN
------------
Effect:    Aileron electric trim runaway. Aircraft rolls.
Fix:       Same electric trim cutoff as ELV_TRIM_RUN.

RUD_TRIM_RUN
------------
Effect:    Rudder electric trim runaway. Yaw develops continuously.
Fix:       Same electric trim cutoff as ELV_TRIM_RUN.

TRIM_ELV / TRIM_AIL / TRIM_RUD
--------------------------------
Effect:    Trim system locked dead after trim runaway fix — the cutoff has
           disconnected the trim motor. Manual trim input still has effect.
Note:      Failures has may appear on their own, or as a follow-up after trim runs.

==============================================================================
 AIRCRAFT-SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS
==============================================================================

The following describes known limitations and behavioral differences for each
aircraft profile in the order they appear in the config file.

--- DEFAULT (all aircraft without a dedicated profile) ----------------------

No specific limitations. All failures enabled at DEFAULT_MTBF unless the
failure itself is documented as OFF. Profiles for unlisted
aircraft should be created by copying DEFAULT and adjusting for the specific
airframe (single vs. twin engine, fixed vs. retractable gear, etc.).

--- C172 — Cessna 172 (Laminar, SEP, fixed gear) --------------

Single-engine aircraft. All _2 engine, pump, oil, magneto, and electrical
failures are disabled (no second engine or second generator/battery in this
configuration).

Constant-speed propeller failures (PROP_FINE, PROP_COARSE) are disabled —
the C172 has a fixed-pitch propeller.

No copilot instruments: ALT_COPILOT and AHZ_COPILOT disabled.

No retractable gear: GEAR_IND, GEAR_RET and GEAR_ACT failures disabled. 
TIRE_4 / TIRE_5 disabled.

Laminar C172 is available with G1000.
Make sure correct settings for equipment you prefer.

No TKS, no HVAC, no window heat, no prop heat, no AOA heat: disabled.

No weather radar: WXR_RADAR disabled.

Either G530/G430 or G1000: NAVCOM1, NAVCOM2 disabled (integrated in avionics suite).

G1000 version: ADR1 and AHRS1 are active. ADR2 and AHRS2 are disabled.
The G1000 has a single ADC and a single AHRS unit.

PITOT_2, PITOT_STBY, STATIC_2, STATIC_ERR_2, ICE_DETECT disabled.

C172 electric trim is elevator only. aileron and rudder trim runaways (AIL_TRIM_RUN,
RUD_TRIM_RUN) and their followups (TRIM_AIL, TRIM_RUD) are disabled.


--- SR22 — Cirrus SR22 (Laminar, G1000, SEP, fixed gear) -------------------

Single-engine aircraft: all _2 engine and oil failures disabled. 
No second electrical bus (ELEC_BUS2), no second generator (GENERATOR_2). [needs to be checked]

G1000 aircraft: steam gauge instruments (ASI_PILOT, AHZ_PILOT, ALT_PILOT,
TSI_PILOT, DGY_PILOT, VVI_PILOT) and G430 units all disabled — the SR22 uses
only the G1000 suite. G1000-specific failures (G_PFD, G_MFD, etc.) are active.

No retractable gear: GEAR_IND, GEAR_ACT, and all GEAR_RET failures disabled.

No NAVCOM radios as standalone units (integrated in G1000): NAVCOM1, NAVCOM2
disabled. G430_GPS1, G430_GPS2 disabled (no G430 fitted).

G1000 only: ADR2 and AHRS2 disabled — single ADC/AHRS unit.

No prop heat, no AOA heat: those failures disabled.

No second pitot or static: PITOT_2, PITOT_STBY, STATIC_2, STATIC_ERR_2
disabled.

No rotating beacon on this model: LITES_BEACON disabled.

Only elevator trim runaway active (AIL_TRIM_RUN, RUD_TRIM_RUN disabled —
same single-engine config as C172).


--- BE58 — SimCoders Baron 58 REP (twin, retractable gear) ------------------

The SimCoders Reality Expansion Pack (REP) intercepts and manages some
aircraft systems internally. Setting many X-Plane failure DataRefs while REP
is active has no effect or produces unpredictable results.

ENGINES AND PROPELLERS — all disabled:
  REP manages the entire engine and propeller simulation including failures,
  wear, and maintenance. All ENG_FAIL, ENG_FIRE, STARTER, MAG, FUEL_PUMP,
  ELE_FUEL_PMP, FUEL_FLOW, OIL_PUMP, OIL_PRESS_LO, AIRFLOW, and all PROP
  failures are set to OFF. Engine fires and their followup smoke remain
  available as manual triggers if needed.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM — all disabled:
  REP manages the B58 electrical system (dual bus, dual battery, dual
  generator) internally. All ELEC_BUS, GENERATOR, BATTERY, GEN0/GEN1/BAT0/BAT1
  voltage failures are set to OFF.

FUEL_WATER / FUEL_TYPE — no effect:
  X-Plane contamination DataRefs have no effect while REP manages engine
  combustion. Disabled.

ENGINE INSTRUMENTS — no effect:
  REP renders all engine instruments (RPM, MP, CHT, EGT, FF, fuel pressure,
  oil pressure, oil temperature) from its own model. X-Plane failure DataRefs
  for these instruments (RPM_IND, MP_IND, CHT_IND, EGT_IND, FF_IND, Fuel QTY,
  FUEL_P_IND, OIL_P_IND, OIL_T_IND) have no effect. All disabled.

PITOT — REP controlled: the primary pitot (PITOT) is managed by REP; no effect.
PITOT_2 — no effect. PITOT_STBY — n/a. Disabled.

STATIC_STBY — no effect: disabled.

OAT — no effect: disabled.

AHZ_COPILOT — no effect: disabled.

G430_GPS2, NAVCOM1, NAVCOM2 — n/a or redundant: disabled.

All G1000 failures — n/a (B58 is not a G1000 aircraft): disabled.
ADR1, ADR2, AHRS1, AHRS2 — n/a (G1000 components): disabled.

WXR_RADAR — no effect: disabled.

GEAR_IND — no effect: disabled. TIRE_4, TIRE_5 — n/a: disabled.

STALL_WARN — n/a: can be tested in flight, behavior uncertain.

AIL_TRIM_RUN / RUD_TRIM_RUN — n/a:
  Aileron and rudder trim on the B58 are not electrically driven; these
  failures have no effect. Disabled. Only ELV_TRIM_RUN is active.

TKS_PUMP, HVAC — n/a on B58 configuration: disabled.

ADF and XPNDR will fail but do not appear in REP maintenance logs.
LOC, GLS, and GPS failures work as described above — they freeze or flag
without REP interference.
Static port failures (STATIC, STATIC_2, STATIC_ERR_1/2) work and affect
pilot and copilot instruments respectively.
Gear collapse (GEAR_COL) cannot be repaired in REP maintenance — a new
flight is required.
Light failures all work. LITES_BEACON affects the fuselage beacon only.
Autopilot failures all work as described.
